## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a web-based application designed to enhance farming efficiency through structured data collection, analysis, and communication.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- **Crop Selection**: Users can select crops they are harvesting.
- **Daily Log**: Users can log daily activities with predefined questions, refined by an LLM, and stored in an Elasticsearch database.
- **Broad Data Visualization**: Officers can review farming data, detect potential issues, and offer guidance.
- **Chat Application**: Users can communicate with officers for support.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- **Guest Users**: Can use unrestricted features such as the chat application without authentication.
- **Registered Users**: Require authentication for restricted features like crop selection and daily logging.
- **Registered Officers**: Require authentication to access broad farming data and respond to user queries.
- **Application Admin**: Manages system maintenance and user authentication.

### 2.4 Constraints
- The system must support role-based authentication for restricted features.
- Compliance with security standards such as encryption for sensitive data.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The system will require external integrations, including LLM-based processing for log refinement and Elasticsearch for data storage.
