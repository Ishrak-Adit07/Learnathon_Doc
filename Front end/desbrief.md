# Design Brief for Application

## 1. Project Overview
The project aims to develop a user-friendly agricultural application that provides essential services such as crop selection, daily logging, chat support, and broad data visualization. The UI should ensure accessibility for both guest users and registered users, with minimal authentication friction.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Farmers (Guest & Registered Users)** – Need an easy-to-use interface for crop selection, daily logs, and disease detection alerts.
- **Officers (Registered Officers)** – Require structured dashboards to analyze farming data and assist users through chat.
- **Application Admins** – Should have an interface for system management and necessary maintenance.

## 3. Objectives & Goals
- Simplify the process of selecting crops and logging daily farming activities.
- Ensure quick access to chat support with officers.
- Provide data insights through visualization tools for officers.
- Enhance usability with AI-driven features like LLM-based disease detection.

## 4. Scope of Work
### Main Screens & Features

#### Home Screen (Dashboard)
- Quick access to crop selection, daily logs, chat, and data visualization.
- Notifications for disease alerts or pending tasks.

#### Crop Selection (Unrestricted)
- A dropdown list for selecting/deselecting crops.
- Confirmation and redirection to the home screen.

#### Daily Log (Restricted)
- A structured question set refined by AI based on past responses & weather data.
- JSON-formatted responses stored in Elasticsearch.

#### Broad Data Visualization (For Officers Only) (Restricted)
- Charts and graphs summarizing farming data.
- Filters for area and crop selection.

#### Chat Application (Unrestricted)
- Farmers can message officers with optional file attachments.
- Officers receive priority-based chat reviews.

## 5. Branding & Visual Guidelines
- **Colors**: Earthy tones with contrasting highlights for alerts.
  - Possible choices: Green, Yellow, Brown, Beige
- **Typography**: Simple and readable fonts
  - Possible choices: Poppins, Roboto, Lexend
- **Icons**: Clear, intuitive, relatable icons representing crops, messages, and logs.

## 6. Technical Constraints
- The UI design should be **mobile-first** for better audience reachability.
- Must integrate seamlessly with **LLM-based AI** and **Elasticsearch** backend.
- Should support **offline functionality** for areas with limited connectivity.

## 7. User Flow & Navigation
- **Guest Users**: Can use chat and explore unrestricted features without login.
- **Registered Users**: Authenticate with minimal effort/help, access personalized features.
- **Officers**: Authenticate, view user logs, analyze farming data, and respond to chats.

## 8. Deliverables
- **Low-fidelity wireframes** for layout approval
- **High-fidelity mockups** for final UI design
- **Interactive prototype** in Figma or Adobe XD

## 9. Timeline & Deadlines
- **Wireframe draft**: 01/02/2025
- **High-fidelity mockups**: [Date]

## 10. Stakeholders & Communication
- **Farmers & Officers**: Provide feedback on usability.
- **Developers**: Ensure seamless integration with AI and database.
